This directory will contain the code for your final coding exam. Only code under this directory and it's subdirectories (as appropriate) will be graded. There will be no CI/Jenkins or email notifications of code change for the final.

Please feel free to create a build file and verify it works by running a canary test and that it produces code coverage. If you like for Venkat to take a look at it before the final exam, please drop him an email. The earlier you do this the higher the chances of your success. Venkat will be glad to review that your build works if requested anytime before May 1st 11:59PM (simply drop an email). Any request after that may not receive a response. Venkat will not send reminders for you to do this. It is up to you to proactively start early and ask for this review.

Details previously sent over the mailing list:

Class,

The final coding exam will be from 7:00PM to 10:00PM CT on Monday May 3rd.

***Please note this is an individual exam and not a pair work.***

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you get ready for the exam.

1. You should work alone. You may consult materials on the internet and books. However, while working on the exam, you should not consult with another person in the class, outside the class, over the internet, SMS, etc.

2. You may check in files as many times as you like during the exam time. I strongly recommend that you check in frequently so you don't lose the files.

3. ** only the last version of files checked in will be graded.

4. You will not have write access to the exam repository after the exam time, so don't wait until the end to check in files, you may run out of time and I will not accept submissions by email, etc.

5. I will send you a link to your individual repository many days before the exam so you can log in early and get it setup on your machine. That way you do a svn up and off your go during the exam start.

6. *** You may also setup your build file ahead of time. That way you don't have to spend the time on set up during the exam. Run a canary test and verify that it is running properly and code coverage is reported. You may ask me to verify that for you also, if you like. I am more than happy to get you prepared and setup ahead of time to improve your chances of success.

Please let me know if you have any questions.


Academic Honesty:
Class,

Here are some do's and don’ts for the final exam:

Do's:

1. Search for anything on the internet
2. Look up any books you like
3. Refer to your own previous works on assignment, homework, etc.

Don’ts:

1. Do not seek help directly from anyone during the exam
2. Do not ask questions or interact with your pair/team member during the exam. This exam is an individual work, not a pair work.
3. Do not post questions on forums and ask for help through the forums
4. Do not ask questions to or help from anyone, including the instructor, during the exam.

In short, please be mindful of academic honesty. I am not asking you to sit in a controlled environment to take the exam. Please respect that and honor the expected honesty.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to let me know.
