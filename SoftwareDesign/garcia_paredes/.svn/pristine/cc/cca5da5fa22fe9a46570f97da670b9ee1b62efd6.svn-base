synopsis~: let's add a few more tests

details: 

Please see suggestions in code.

Let's add a few more tests.
-score for guess where it has letters not in word: "bayou" and guess "bye"
-score for guess with repeat letters: "relate" and guess "rear"

Let's do a quick review after these changes. Please modify the requestReview.txt file and check it in as soon as you are ready and I will do a review well before the next scheduled review cycle.

synopsis: jumping ahead faster than we should

details: 

The code is dealing with spell check but non of the tests at this time should be concerned with spelling. Please remove all references to things related to spell check. Let's do a review after that.

synopsis~: let's revisit some tests

details: 

Good tests so far. Let's make sure the following are covered:
-score for a letter guess that is part of the word - "apple" and guess "a"
-score for guess that is part of the word - word "monkey" and guess "monk"
-score for guess that is part of the word but not continuous - word "apple" and guess "ape"
-score for guess with no vowel - word "bayou" and guess "by" 

Let's do a quick review after these changes. Please modify the requestReview.txt file and check it in as soon as you are ready and I will do a review well before the next scheduled review cycle.
