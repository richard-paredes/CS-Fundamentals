Good start.

Let's create FibonacciImperativeTest and a file fibonacci_imperative with a function fibonacci.

Let's make sure these tests are covered:
-fibonacci for position 0
-fibonacci for position 1
-fibonacci for position 2
-fibonacci for position 3
-fibonacci for position 5
-fibonacci for position 10
-fibonacci for position -1

Let's do a quick review after these changes. Please modify the requestReview.txt file and check it in as soon as you are ready and I will do a review well before the next scheduled review cycle.
