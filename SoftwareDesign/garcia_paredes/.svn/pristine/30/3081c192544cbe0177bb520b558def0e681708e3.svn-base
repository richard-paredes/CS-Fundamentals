synopsis: let's bring in examples related to experiences

details: 

Please spellcheck.

Good so far. In each of the paragraph let's bring in details related to our own experiences in this course and outside. How did we apply and/or benefit from these rules.

How do we handle the situation when rules conflict with one another?

Let's write a concluding paragraph, bringing the ideas together.
