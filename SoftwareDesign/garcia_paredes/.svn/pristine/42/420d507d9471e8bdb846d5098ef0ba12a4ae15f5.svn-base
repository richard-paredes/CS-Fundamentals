synopsis: good so far

details: 

Good so far. Please see suggestions in code.

-Time to implement the code to talk to the spellcheck service
 -get response from the service URL and confirm a text was received
 -parse text "true" and return boolean true
 -parse text "false" and return boolean false
 -parse text "something else" and ...
 -isSpellingCorrect should take a word and returns true for word "right"
 -isSpellingCorrect should take a word and returns false for word "rigth"
 -isSpellingCorrect should take a word and returns false for word "haha"
 -isSpellingCorrect handles exception from get response properly
  (all the above tests for isSpellingCorrect do not use the real get response but a mock, the next one will use the real function)
 -an integration test for isSpellingCorrect that takes word "correct" and returns true

synopsis: good so far, let's fine tune and move forward

details: 

Please see suggestions in code.

After that, let's address:
-score for word with correct spelling, but the spell checker throws a runtime exception possibly due to a network error

-pick a random word from a list of words
-second pick from same list returns a different word
-pick a random word from a list of words when the list is empty

details: 

The code is dealing with spell check but non of the tests at this time should be concerned with spelling. Please remove all references to things related to spell check. Let's do a review after that.

Good tests so far. Let's make sure the following are covered:
