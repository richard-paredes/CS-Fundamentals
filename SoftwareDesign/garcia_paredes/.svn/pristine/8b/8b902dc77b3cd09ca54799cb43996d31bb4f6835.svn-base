The Fibonacci series of numbers start with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
where values at position 0 and 1 are 1, and values at each position after
that are a sum of values at the previous two positions.

Write four implementations of a function to compute the Fibonacci number at a given position.

Please start with one implementation at a time rather than rushing through all
of them at the same time.

The four implementations are described below:

1. An imperative iteration. 
  Given a position n, loop through totaling values until you reach the value for the given position.

2. A functional iteration. 
	  Given a position n, loop through totaling values until you reach the value for the given position. Avoid explicit mutability.

3. A simple recursion.
  Given a position, compute the value at a position using the expression fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).

4. A memoized recursion.
  Given a position, look up to see if the value has been precomputed and if so return that value. Otherwise, use recursion to compute the value.
  
Confirms that the memoized version is faster than the recursive version.

Reuse as much code as possible.

Please bring forward the practices, techniques, and tools you have learned so far. This includes: 
Good code quality
Lightweight design
Minimum code
Automated testing                                                         
Code coverage
Continuous integration

Once you complete coding, please answer the following:
