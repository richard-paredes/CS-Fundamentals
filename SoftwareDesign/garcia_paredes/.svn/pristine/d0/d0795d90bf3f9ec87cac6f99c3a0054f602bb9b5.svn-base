#Feedback: missing test list here that are being implemented.

- check number of mined cells equal to 10
- check mined cells are initially hidden
- check for at minimum one instance of empty cell
- check for at minimum one instance of adjacent cell
- check adjacent cell is neighboring at minimum one mined cell
