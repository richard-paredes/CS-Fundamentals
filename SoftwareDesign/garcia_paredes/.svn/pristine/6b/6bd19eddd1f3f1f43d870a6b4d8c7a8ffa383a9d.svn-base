x call setMines(0) and setMines(1) and verify there is at least one mine at a different location between the two calls

- check all cells are initially greyed out
- user right click seals cell 
- user left click exposes cell 
- check user has options to seal/unseal and expose cells
- check unexposed adjacent cell count hidden from user
- check exposed adjacent cell count displayed to user
