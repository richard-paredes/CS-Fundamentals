synopsis: let's honor DRY and OCP

details: 

Let's honor DRY and OCP. Please see suggestions in code.

Need to align code to the given problem. Please see these parts in assign4.txt:

***Design so that other such functions may be added in the future, but 
without changing any existing class.

***The user of your design will pick and choose what kinds of operations
they want to use or combine to use. For example, I may be interested
in combining the stupid remover and the lower case operation when
writing to a String. I may also be interested in combining the
duplicate remover and the upper case operation when writing to
a file. I may chose to use any combination of these operations
at will.

You can imagine an operation like this (pseudocode):

writeToWriter(Writer writer) {
  writer.write("This is really really stupid!!!")
  writer.close();
}

If I had combined the operations of duplicate remover, stupid remover,
and if the writer is targeting a file (say myfile.dat), then the file
myfile.dat would contain the content

This is really s*****!!!
