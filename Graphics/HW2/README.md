## To build and execute the program
Navigate to the directory containing hw2.cpp, then execute the following commands in the terminal: 

#### To build and execute on Windows using Visual Studio:
> Open the Assignment2/Assignment2.sln using Visual Studio. Once opened, build and execute the project with a build configuration of Debug and target x86.

#### To execute on Windows without Visual Studio
> Execute the hw2.exe file
> * Note: Make sure the executable file is in the same directory as the freeglut.dll file, otherwise the executable will fail.

## Program output:
- A window containing a scene with objects. The scenes can be changed using 1, 2, 3, 4 to view each corresponding scene in the homework assignment.
