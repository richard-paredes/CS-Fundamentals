# CS-Fundamentals

Interested in what it's like to study to Computer Science? Take a look at some of the things I've learned over the course of a couple of years.

## <a href="https://github.com/richard-paredes/CS-Fundamentals/tree/main/IntroToProgramming">IntroToProgramming</a>
Like most traditional pathways, it all begins with learning how to make a computer do something useful. `IntroToProgramming` is where the deep dive into computer science begins!

## <a href="https://github.com/richard-paredes/CS-Fundamentals/tree/main/DataStructures">DataStructures</a>
Learning how to program is just the beginning. Now it's time to learn how to make these programs better by abstracting logic into refined `Data Structures`.

## <a href="https://github.com/richard-paredes/CS-Fundamentals/tree/main/Algorithms">Algorithms</a>
What good is a program if it's too slow to run? Learning `Algorithms` helps create more efficient programs by getting challenged with various brain-teaser problems.

## <a href="https://github.com/richard-paredes/CS-Fundamentals/tree/main/Databases">Databases</a>
Almost every popular software has some kind of data persistence. But what's that, and how does it work? Understanding `Databases` is an immensely important topic when working with real-world software.

## <a href="https://github.com/richard-paredes/CS-Fundamentals/tree/main/OperatingSystems">Operating Systems</a>
There is so much focus on learning how to develop programs at a higher level. Yet, the `Operating Systems` on our computer manage so many resources and play a vital role in ensuring all the processes play fair.

## <a href="https://github.com/richard-paredes/CS-Fundamentals/tree/main/Graphics">Graphics</a>
Wait! You're seeing this... but did you ever stop to ask how? With `Graphics`, explore the graphics pipeline in OpenGL and how it all connects to make pretty things show up on your screen!

## <a href="https://github.com/richard-paredes/CS-Fundamentals/tree/main/InteractiveComputerGraphics">Interactive Computer Graphics</a>
Admittedly, learning the graphics pipeline can be a bit tedious with all the linear algebra. Make it fun with `Interactive Computer Graphics`! Games are always fun to develop and a great way to strengthen the programming fundamentals.

## <a href="https://github.com/richard-paredes/CS-Fundamentals/tree/main/ArtificialIntelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>
You mean to say a computer can learn? How does that work? Learn all about the interesting techniques used to make programs have interesting behaviors with `Artificial Intelligence`. Check out how to find the best path to somewhere or how a program learns to transform random pixels into recognizable digits!

## <a href="https://github.com/richard-paredes/CS-Fundamentals/tree/main/SoftwareDesign">Software Design</a>
Writing code is easy. However, writing good code that stands the test of time and that others can work with is hard. But, there are common principles and patterns that can be learned to develop with great `Software Design`.

> This doesn't include everything I've accomplished during my studies. In a few cases, tasks were submitted on a remote server, so I wasn't able to save the work.
> Also, not everything I've learned has been through structured courses! Sometimes, just experimenting with new tools and testing out project ideas has helped me grow into a better software developer.
